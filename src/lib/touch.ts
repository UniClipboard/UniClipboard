/**
 * The same opt-out for a gesture surface that wraps content the consumer owns:
 * a scroller, a context-menu trigger, a sheet header, a list row. Selection is
 * suppressed only where the platform runs its own press gestures — a coarse
 * pointer — so a mouse user can still select and copy that content. If the
 * gesture itself would paint a selection under the cursor, add `select-none`
 * for the duration of the gesture rather than reaching for
 * `TOUCH_GESTURE_CLASS`.
 *
 * `pointer: coarse` describes the *primary* pointer and nothing else, so a
 * hybrid machine reads it wrong in both directions: a tablet with a mouse
 * plugged in keeps touch as primary and loses mouse selection, and a laptop
 * with a touchscreen keeps the mouse as primary and leaves selection live
 * under a finger. No media query can answer per interaction — the query is
 * about the device, and the question is about the gesture in progress. The
 * default stays here because it is right on the machines that are one thing or
 * the other, and losing a selection is a nuisance; where the miss costs a
 * *gesture* instead, the surface pairs it with `holdSelection` on the press.

 * For the press gestures a native selection would otherwise steal — a

 * takes selection away for the whole session is a surface whose text nobody
